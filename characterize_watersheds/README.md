1. Assemble input datasets

    a. Pull streamcat data (0_fetch_streamcat.py)
    b. Generate WARP input datasets (0_generate_warp_inputs.py)
    c. Generate curve numbers (0_generate_curve_number.py)
    d. Overlay points with catchments (0_overlay_points.py)

2. Join all input datasets (join_tables.py)
