1. Get all required input datasets (weather files, weather file grid, NHD Plus) and make sure paths in paths.py
point to these files

2. Create a shapefile from your lat/longs

3. Adjust the 'run id' (can be anything you want) and input shapefile parameters in paths.py

4. Run 0_overlay_points.py. This will overlay the sample sites onto NHD Plus catchments and regions

5. Run 1_get_watersheds.py using the point/NHD pairs generated in step 1. This identifies all upstream
reaches for each sampling point.

6. Run 2_watershed_grid.py. This identifies the weather grid cells that overlap the watersheds for each
intake location, and the proportion of grid cells that overlap the edges.

7. Run 3_pull_time_series.py.  This will add up all the precipitation time series for each watershed
and apply time of travel offsets
