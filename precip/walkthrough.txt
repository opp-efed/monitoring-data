Start with a shapefile of sample sites

1. Run characterize_watersheds\0_overlay_points.py. This will overlay the sample sites onto NHD Plus catchments with

2. Run precipitation\0_get_watersheds.py using the point/NHD pairs generated in step 1. This identifies all upstream
reaches for each sampling point.

3. Run precipitation\1_watershed_grid.py. This identifies the weather grid cells that overlap the watersheds for each
intake location, and the proportion of grid cells that overlap the edges.

4. Run precipitation\2_pull_time_series.py.  This will add up all the precipitation time series for each watershed
and apply time of travel offsets
